## How It Works

1. *Question Rendering*:  
   - The questions and options are imported from data.js, which contains a JSON array of questions and answers.
   - The app starts with the first question displayed dynamically.

2. *Answer Selection*:  
   - Users can select an answer by clicking on an option.  
   - The selected option is highlighted using CSS classes (selected).

3. *Next Question Logic*:  
   - Clicking the "Next" button checks if the selected answer is correct.  
   - If correct, the score is incremented.  
   - The app then moves to the next question. If it's the last question, the quiz ends.

4. *Score Calculation*:  
   - The app keeps track of the score using React's useState.  
   - Once all questions are answered, the final score is displayed along with the total number of questions.

5. *Quiz Completion*:  
   - When the quiz ends, a summary screen shows the userâ€™s score and the total questions.
